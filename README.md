#nvdrv-ubuntu
This was an old script I wrote to help me automate the nvidia driver install in Ubuntu.

It works, but it's far from perfect.  I am sharing the code, if someone has time to help make it better, it's a good start to help with an 
overall automation framework.  Some to-do items to help make this better, update package repos in realtime, if needed, add a check for the 
specific hardware types that would allow for the nvidia install to be successful and consistent.  Add better error checking, add better logging, etc.
