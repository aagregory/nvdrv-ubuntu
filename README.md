#nvdrv-ubuntu
This was an old script I wrote to help me automate the nvidia driver install in Ubuntu.
##Notes and use warnings, about this script.
It worked for me initially, but it is very far from perfect.  I am sharing the code, if someone has time to help make it better, 
it's a good start to help with an overall automation framework.  Some to-do items to help make this 
better, update package repos in realtime, if needed, add a check for the specific hardware types that 
would allow for the nvidia install to be successful and consistent.  Add better error checking, add 
better logging, etc.
